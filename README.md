Welcome to  Django project on Cloud9 IDE!

Here are the specific details about this project:

1) User can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

2) If it does contain date, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

3) If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
